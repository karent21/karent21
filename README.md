## In the future, I aspire to be a mechanical engineer, aerospace engineer, or software developer. I like solving math problems and expressing my creativity through design. I am interested in the way machines, airplanes, and computers work. I also believe that these careers will strengthen my critical thinking and communication skills. These careers are essential because they make everyday life efficient. They also offer financial stability, which is important for me to live an independent and stable future.
